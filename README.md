# A latex template for your research diary
Doing research and not getting lost in the nitty gritty details or becoming a master procrastinator can be hard sometimes. A research diary or journal, which helps you documenting your progress, feelings and learnings, can have a big impact on your research success[^1].

After reading a lot about journaling during a PhD I went about searching for a clean and simple latex template that would help me to get started.
However, I only found either classic lab reports or overly complicated solutions. 

Thus, I set up my own document that **provides a basic structure for doing daily journaling and also assists with reviewing ones progress on a weekly basis**.

This template is as easy as it gets. This is the whole purpose of this repository - to facilitate your setup of your own research diary!
I have uploaded a pdf-version *template_en.pdf* of this template so that you can check out whether you like the structure or not.

Also, I have provided a German version of this template. It is called *template_de.tex*
